PURPOSE: Create the game of BlackJack, using a standard deck of cards. User will
be prompted various options, and face against the CPU.

MOTIVATION: I wanted to refresh my memory and code in Java in preparation for 
the next quarter. I also plan on making small projects on Android Studio in Java 
following this.
